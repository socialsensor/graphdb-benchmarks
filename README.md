graphdb-benchmarks
==================
The project graphdb-benchmarks is a benchmark between popular graph databases.
Currently the framework supports [Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/),
[OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/), and [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/).
The purpose of this benchmark is to examine the performance of each graph database in
terms of execution time. The benchmark is composed of four workloads, Clustering, Massive
Insertion, Single Insertion and Query Workload. Every workload has been designed to
simulate common operations in graph database systems.

- *Clustering Workload (CW)*: CW consists of a well-known community detection algorithm
for modularity optimization, the Louvain Method. We adapt the algorithm on top of the
benchmarked graph databases and employ cache techniques to take advantage of both graph
database capabilities and in-memory execution speed. We measure the time the algorithm
needs to converge.
- *Massive Insertion Workload (MIW)*: we create the graph database and configure it for
massive loading, then we populate it with a particular data set. We measure the time for
the creation of the whole graph.
- *Single Insertion Workload (SIW)*: we create the graph database and load it with a
particular data set. Every object insertion (node or edge) is committed directly and
the graph is constructed incrementally. We measure the insertion time per block, which
consists of one thousand edges and the nodes that appear during the insertion of these
edges.
- *Query Workload (QW)*: we execute three common queries:
  * FindNeighbours (FN): finds the neighbors of all nodes.
  * FindAdjacentNodes (FA): finds the adjacent nodes of all edges.
  * FindShortestPath (FS): finds the shortest path between a random node and 100 other random nodes.

Here we measure the execution time of each query.

For our evaluation we use both synthetic and real data. More specifically, we execute
MIW, SIW and QW with real data derived from the SNAP data set collection
([Enron data set](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html),
[Amazon data set](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0601.html),
[Youtube data set](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Youtube.html) and
[LiveJournal data set](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-LiveJournal.html)). On the
other hand, with the CW we use synthetic data generated with the
[LFR-Benchmark generator](https://sites.google.com/site/andrealancichinetti/files) which
produces networks with power-law degree distribution and implanted communities within the
network. The synthetic data can be downloaded from
[here](http://figshare.com/articles/Synthetic_Data_for_graphdb_benchmark/1221760).

For further information about the study please refer to the
[published paper](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10518-5_1) on
Springer site and the presentation on
[Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/sympapadopoulos/adbis2014-presentation).

**Note 1:** The published paper contains the experimental study of Titan, OrientDB and Neo4j.
After the publication we included the Sparksee graph database. Sparksee does not implement TinkerPop 3 yet.

**Note 2:** After the very useful comments and contributions of OrientDB developers, we
updated the benchmark implementations and re-run the experiments. We have updated the
initial presentation with the new results and uploaded a new version of the paper in the
following [link](http://mklab.iti.gr/files/beis_adbis2014_corrected.pdf).

**Note 3:** Alexander Patrikalakis, a software developer at Amazon Web Services, refactored
the benchmark, added support for Apache TinkerPop 3 and added support for the DynamoDB Storage
Backend for Titan. He also added support for the Tupl Storage Backend for Titan.

Instructions
------------
To run the project at first you have to choose one of the aforementioned data sets. Of
course you can select any data set, but because there is not any utility class to
convert the data set in the appropriate format (for now), the format of the data must
be identical with the tested data sets. The input parameters are configured from the
src/test/resources/input.properties file. Please follow the instructions in this file
to select the correct parameters. Then, run `mvn install && mvn test -Pbench` to execute the
benchmarking run.

Note, Find Shortest Path benchmark is currently broken.
Consequently, I did not update the QW-FS numbers.
Also, OrientDB's TP3 implementation is not official yet,
so I did not run numbers for OrientDB as well.
These benchmarks were performed on the RAM disk (/dev/shm) of a m4.10xlarge with a maximum heap size of 32 GiB.

I also analyzed storage the footprint of each of these databases.
I conclude that the storage footprint in MiB for all of them is linear with respect
to the number of vertices and edges.

Applying least squares optimization to this multitude of data points yields the following estimates of space
in bytes required to store each vertex and edge (assuming no labels and no properties).

| Bytes on disk | Titan-BDB | Titan-Tupl | Neo4j     |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Per vertex    | 0.212     | **0.082**  |   0.090   |
| Per edge      | 0.108     |   0.055    | **0.034** |
